## Abstract
This analysis was done to show the correlation between the net survival rate and the age-standardized survival rate this was executed by means of regression analysis. The data did show very strong correlations between these variables since they are very closely related, but due to the lack of variables it was difficult to find an angle to approach this analysis. This close correlation indicates that there is a connection between the age-standardized and all-ages five-year net survival estimates for lung and bronchus cancer.
## Introduction
This project uses regression analysis techniques taught in MATH/STAT 3340 to determine relationships between variables within the datasets. For this analysis dataset 1 was assigned but there was no appropriate data to work with, so the data was collected from Statistics Canada. The age-standardized and all-ages five-year net survival estimates for lung and bronchus cancer, both sexes, by province was used for the complete regression analysis. The main goal was to determine if there is a relationship between the age-standardized and all-ages five-year net survival, and the number of eligible cases. Each dataset contains three years of cumulative data which overlap throughout the three datasets. 
## Data Description
Using Statistics Canada, data was compiled for lung and bronchus cancer from 2006-2010. Using R, the data was compiled and processed individually. First the data was read into the R script in three separate data files. Dataset 1 is the data compiled from 2008-2010, datasets two and there are from 2007-2009 and 2006-2008, respectively. Once all data was readily accessible, comparative plots were created to determine if there was any linearity between the variables.
_No extra data point was added because we forgot and did not fully understand what type of data point to add._
## Methods
1. The data packages were downloaded as CSV files and loaded into the R program. <br/>
2. All data variables were compared in plots to distinguish any possible correlation in data. <br/>
3. 95% confidence interval plots were created for each dataset. <br/>
4. Lastly, the linear models for each dataset were created.
## Results
_Since the plots will not insert properly they will be referenced to the Project5 file_ <br/>
Figures 1 a-c indicates a near linear relationship between the five-year net survival and age standardized year net survival.<br/>
Figure 2 a-c indicates that all regions have approximately 17 cases that will survive the 5 year survival rate.
## Conclusion
To discover the relation between age-standardized and all-ages five-year net survival estimates for lung and bronchus cancer, a regression analysis was performed on each data set from 2006-2010. Plots of interaction and confidence intervals were created to visually demonstrate the relationships between variables. From the data that was collected in this project, it was visualized that there was very little correlation between variables. Although it was observed that there were linear tendencies in age-standardized and all-ages five-year net survival estimate variables.
