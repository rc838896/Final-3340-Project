## Abstract

## Introduction
This project uses regression analysis techniques taught in MATH/STAT 3340 to determine relationships between variables within the datasets. For this analysis dataset 1 was assigned but there was no appropriate data to work with, so the data was collected from Statistics Canada. The age-standardized and all-ages five-year net survival estimates for lung and bronchus cancer, both sexes, by province was used for the complete regression analysis. The main goal was to determine if there is a relationship between the age-standardized and all-ages five-year net survival, and the number of eligible cases. Each dataset contains three years of cumulative data which overlap throughout the three datasets. 
## Data Description
Using Statistics Canada, data was compiled for lung and bronchus cancer from 2006-2010. Using R, the data was compiled and processed individually. First the data was read into the R script in three separate data files. Dataset 1 is the data compiled from 2008-2010, datasets two and there are from 2007-2009 and 2006-2008, respectively. Once all data was readily accessible, comparative plots were created to determine if there was any linearity between the variables.

## Methods
1. The data packages were downloaded as CSV files and loaded into the R program. <br/>
2. All data variables were compared in plots to distinguish any possible correlation in data. <br/>
3. 95% confidence interval plots were created for each dataset. <br/>
4. Lastly, the linear models for each dataset were created.
